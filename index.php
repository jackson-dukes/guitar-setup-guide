      <h2>Getting Started</h2>
      
      <p>An electric guitar setup is a process of adjusting and optimizing the instrument to ensure that it plays well and sounds great. A properly set up guitar can make playing easier, more comfortable, and more enjoyable, and can also improve the tone and sustain of the instrument.</p>

      <p>Here's a brief overview of the key components of a typical electric guitar setup:</p>

      <ol>
        <li><a href="strings.php">Changing strings</a>: The first step in a guitar setup is usually to change the strings. This involves removing the old strings, cleaning the guitar, and installing new strings. Fresh strings can improve the tone and playability of the guitar, and should be changed regularly to maintain optimal performance.</li>

        <li><a href="trussrod.php">Adjusting the truss rod</a>: The truss rod is a metal rod that runs through the neck of the guitar and helps to counteract the tension of the strings. Adjusting the truss rod can help to correct problems with the neck's curvature and relieve fret buzzing. However, it's important to be careful when adjusting the truss rod, as over-tightening or loosening it can damage the guitar.</li>

        <li><a href="action.php">Setting the action</a>: The action refers to the height of the strings above the fretboard. A proper action height can make the guitar easier to play and reduce fret buzzing. To adjust the action, you'll need to adjust the height of the guitar's bridge.</li>

        <li><a href="intonation.php">Intonation</a>: Intonation refers to the accuracy of the guitar's pitch along the entire length of the fretboard. If the intonation is off, notes played higher up on the fretboard may sound out of tune. Adjusting the intonation involves adjusting the position of the guitar's bridge saddles.</li>

        <li><a href="pickups.php">Pickup height</a>: The pickup height refers to the distance between the guitar's pickups and the strings. Adjusting the pickup height can affect the tone of the guitar, and can be used to balance the output of different pickups or adjust the overall tone of the instrument.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Overall, a proper electric guitar setup can make a big difference in the playability and sound of your instrument. While some aspects of guitar setup may require professional expertise, many guitarists are able to learn how to perform basic setup procedures themselves with some practice and patience.</p>
